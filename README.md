# mandelbrot
My command line Mandelbrot program

I wrote this back in high school, but it still works so I figured I'd document it. You can use the tool to create Mandelbrot images,
with basic zooming and iteration count control. It doesn't produce PNGs and JPGs since those require compression,
so you need to open images in a tool like GIMP.
